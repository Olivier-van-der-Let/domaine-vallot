# Domaine Vallot – Comprehensive Research Summary

## 1\. Historical & Family Heritage

- **Five generations of winemakers.** Domaine Vallot is among the oldest estates in the Côtes‑du‑Rhône. It was founded five generations ago and has remained in the Vallot family ever since[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=With%20their%20founding%20five%20generations,Demeter%20biodynamic%20certification%20in%202007). Fourth‑generation vigneron François Vallot modernised the domaine in the 1990s. He adopted organic farming early and obtained Ecocert certification in 2003, then achieved Demeter biodynamic certification in 2007[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=With%20their%20founding%20five%20generations,Demeter%20biodynamic%20certification%20in%202007).
    
- **Return of the fifth generation.** François’s daughter, **Anaïs Vallot**, pursued a career in international hotel management. She studied in Paris and Sydney, worked for the Four Seasons in several countries and managed a five‑star hotel in Geneva before returning to her roots in 2013. Before rejoining the family domaine, she interned at Château d’Yquem to perfect her winemaking skills[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Now%2C%20as%20the%20fifth%20generation,her%20work%20at%20Domaine%20Vallot). Anaïs now steers the estate with a youthful and global perspective while honouring her family’s heritage[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/portraits/anais-vallot-en/#:~:text=Ana%C3%AFs%20promotes%20a%20prestigious%2C%20international,worlds%20of%20luxury%20and%20travel).
    
- **Modernization and tradition.** François and Anaïs believe in respectful modernization—maintaining traditional methods while embracing innovations such as biodynamics. Cement vats and native yeasts, rather than stainless steel, are used to preserve elegance and freshness[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=They%20have%20always%20utilized%20the,yeasts%20present%20in%20the%20vineyard%E2%80%A6). The goal is to make wines that are both authentic to Vinsobres and relevant to modern palates.
    

## 2\. Terroir & Place

- **Location within the Rhône Valley.** Domaine Vallot lies in the village of **Vinsobres** in Drôme Provençale, between Nyons and Vaison‑la‑Romaine![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-d3a0-61f6-b803-f9f0c3d384ad/raw?se=2025-09-26T07%3A34%3A00Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=4e28d40f-3854-590f-b9f6-3416507eade3&skoid=f28c0102-4d9d-4950-baf0-4a8e5f6cf9d4&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-09-25T17%3A52%3A59Z&ske=2025-09-26T17%3A52%3A59Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=TuNPcunoi2yM9YSZqY8XUtpbiIrJ7O0LUdN6PcFxgws%3D)domainevallot.com. The vines occupy south‑facing slopes at **altitudes of 200–450 m**, making Vinsobres one of the highest appellations in the Côtes‑du‑Rhône[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Situated%20in%20Proven%C3%A7al%20Dr%C3%B4me%2C%20on,in%20the%20commune%20of%20Vinsobres).
    
- **Micro‑climate shaped by mountains and winds.** The estate sits between the Pre‑Alps and Mont Ventoux. Hot Mediterranean summers are tempered by two local winds: the **Mistral** and the **Pontias**, which cool the nights and slow grape maturation[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Situated%20in%20Proven%C3%A7al%20Dr%C3%B4me%2C%20on,in%20the%20commune%20of%20Vinsobres). This micro‑climate gives Vinsobres the freshness and structure of northern Rhône wines while retaining southern ripeness.
    
- **Soil diversity.** High‑altitude vineyards are planted on **south‑east‑facing limestone slopes** at the start of the Alpine foothills[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=High%20altitude%20vineyards%20surround%20Vinsobres%2C,key%20concept%20for%20the%20definition). Soils are **rocky and rich in limestone** with **patches of sandy soil**[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=High%20altitude%20vineyards%20surround%20Vinsobres%2C,key%20concept%20for%20the%20definition). The terroir is divided into four zones: the **first terrace** (200‑250 m), **coteau** (250‑350 m), **collines** (300‑450 m) and **plateau** (350‑450 m)[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Four%20rich%20and%20varied%20terroirs).
    
- **Appellation history.** Vinsobres was part of the Côtes‑du‑Rhône Villages from 1967 until 2006, when it became the **first Cru of the Côtes‑du‑Rhône in Drôme Provençale**[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Vinsobres%2C%20what%20an%20unusual%20name%3A,the%20pride%20of%20its%20winemakers). The name Vinsobres may derive from the Latin _Vinsobris_ meaning **“vine”** and **“work,”** underscoring the village’s identity as a community of winegrowers[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Vinsobres%2C%20what%20an%20unusual%20name%3A,the%20pride%20of%20its%20winemakers).
    

## 3\. Philosophy & Craft

- **Organic and biodynamic farming.** François Vallot began converting to organic farming in the early 1990s. The vineyards received **Ecocert organic certification in 2003** and **Demeter biodynamic certification in 2007**[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=With%20their%20founding%20five%20generations,Demeter%20biodynamic%20certification%20in%202007). Biodynamics aims to enhance plant vitality by improving interactions between soil, roots, and cosmic influences; it seeks to strengthen vines’ natural defenses and express terroir more transparently![](https://sdmntprukwest.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-c150-6243-8b0b-c45ad9cc05ff/raw?se=2025-09-26T07%3A33%3A59Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=f6242daf-7ad7-5ec6-9d40-83690cfd5dac&skoid=f28c0102-4d9d-4950-baf0-4a8e5f6cf9d4&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-09-25T17%3A52%3A56Z&ske=2025-09-26T17%3A52%3A56Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=qoSqnEMK6ScFm8xxl5TLXi8z7GZ9LZU/bcH9Nhw5aYk%3D)domainevallot.com. Anaïs continues these practices, plowing soils and working according to lunar and seasonal rhythms[nicolazanetti.it](https://www.nicolazanetti.it/pdf/CLASSY_Wines.pdf#:~:text=La%20famiglia%20Vallot%20possiede%20questa,C%C3%94TES%20DU%20RH%C3%94NE).
    
- **Vineyard management.** The estate cultivates a mosaic of traditional Rhône varieties—**grenache, syrah, mourvèdre, cinsault, clairette, bourboulenc and viognier**—as bush vines (goblet training)[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=The%20vineyards%20at%20Domaine%20Vallot,at%20bottling%2C%20rather%20small%20amounts). Vines are about 40 years old for the Côtes‑du‑Rhône blend and 65 years old for the flagship Vinsobres plots[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=average%20age%20of%2040%20years,aging%20in%20traditional%20cement%20vats). Only minimal sulphur is used during vinification and none at bottling; the aim is to add just what the wine demands[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=bush%20vine%20%28goblet%29%20method,the%20conditions%20of%20each%20vintage).
    
- **Cellar practices.** Grapes ferment spontaneously using **native yeasts** in traditional **cement vats**. Cement allows slow heating and cooling, giving winemakers control without mechanical refrigeration and preserving the wines’ elegance and freshness[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=They%20have%20always%20utilized%20the,yeasts%20present%20in%20the%20vineyard%E2%80%A6). For the Cru Vinsobres, grenache and mourvèdre are co‑fermented, while syrah ferments separately; wines age in concrete for more than a year[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Her%20flagship%20Cru%20Vinsobres%20is,vats%20for%20over%20one%20year).
    

## 4\. People & Community

- **François Vallot – pioneer of biodynamics.** As the fourth generation, François championed organic and biodynamic practices and built the reputation of the domaine. His respect for terroir and passion for quality set the foundation for the estate’s ethos[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=With%20their%20founding%20five%20generations,Demeter%20biodynamic%20certification%20in%202007).
    
- **Anaïs Vallot – guardian of heritage and ambassador.** Anaïs returned to Vinsobres at age 28 after working in luxury hotels worldwide[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Now%2C%20as%20the%20fifth%20generation,her%20work%20at%20Domaine%20Vallot). She brings hospitality experience and a global mindset, focusing on elegance, customer experience and a broader outreach. Her story underscores the balance between tradition and contemporary vision[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/portraits/anais-vallot-en/#:~:text=Ana%C3%AFs%20promotes%20a%20prestigious%2C%20international,worlds%20of%20luxury%20and%20travel).
    
- **Artisans and team.** Though specific names are rarely cited, the domaine employs local vineyard workers and cellar hands who share the Vallots’ dedication. Biodynamic farming requires year‑round observation and manual labour; the community’s knowledge is vital to preserving the terroir.
    

## 5\. Wines & Expression

- **Côtes‑du‑Rhône – field blend.** The domaine produces an entry‑level **Côtes‑du‑Rhône red** made from a **field blend** of grenache, syrah, mourvèdre, cinsault, clairette and bourboulenc. Grapes are co‑picked and vinified together from 40‑year‑old vines on calcareous limestone soils, then fermented and aged in cement vats[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Ana%C3%AFs%20leads%20off%20her%20production,aging%20in%20traditional%20cement%20vats). The wine is described as fresh, friendly and gulp‑able, with red‑fruit vibrancy and spice[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Ana%C3%AFs%20leads%20off%20her%20production,aging%20in%20traditional%20cement%20vats).
    
- **Cru Vinsobres – Le Coriançon.** The flagship **Vinsobres “Le Coriançon”** blends grenache, syrah and mourvèdre from hillside plots at 200–450 m. Grapes are destemmed; grenache and mourvèdre co‑ferment, while syrah ferments separately; wines age in concrete for over a year[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Her%20flagship%20Cru%20Vinsobres%20is,vats%20for%20over%20one%20year). Tasting notes from distributors describe a ruby colour with purple hints, intense aromas of red and dark fruits, spice and floral notes, a balanced palate with good tannins and a long, fruity finish![](https://sdmntpritalynorth.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-97a4-6246-9e6b-0b976283d692/raw?se=2025-09-26T07%3A33%3A59Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=59e6aa10-6c42-5ece-ac9b-d1861f8eaba9&skoid=f28c0102-4d9d-4950-baf0-4a8e5f6cf9d4&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-09-25T17%3A53%3A02Z&ske=2025-09-26T17%3A53%3A02Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=yo1AL1cgSydj4ubdWb%2Bvb3cEZEjtH3vaCniLjwJSaV8%3D).
    
- **Les Roches – Côtes‑du‑Rhône parcel selection.** Another cuvée, **“Les Roches,”** is a parcel selection (around 3 ha) of grenache, syrah and mourvèdre produced under biodynamic certification. It exhibits ruby colour, aromas of red and dark fruits with spicy and floral notes, a well‑balanced palate and long aftertaste![](https://sdmntpritalynorth.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-97a4-6246-9e6b-0b976283d692/raw?se=2025-09-26T07%3A33%3A59Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=59e6aa10-6c42-5ece-ac9b-d1861f8eaba9&skoid=f28c0102-4d9d-4950-baf0-4a8e5f6cf9d4&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-09-25T17%3A53%3A02Z&ske=2025-09-26T17%3A53%3A02Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=yo1AL1cgSydj4ubdWb%2Bvb3cEZEjtH3vaCniLjwJSaV8%3D).
    
- **Other bottlings.** The estate also makes **Claude Vallot** (not fully documented due to limited sources) and possibly **L’Exception** or **Le Haut des Côtes**; these likely highlight old vines or single parcels. In general, Domaine Vallot wines are characterised by ripe red and dark fruit, pepper and garrigue aromatics, silky tannins, freshness from altitude and ageability[pspglobalwines.com](https://pspglobalwines.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/PSP-VERSION-DOMAINE-VALLOT-LES-ROCHES-COTES-DU-RHONE.pdf).
    

## 6\. Cultural & Aesthetic Dimension

- **Landscape and architecture.** The domaine is set among rolling hills lined with olive and almond trees, with vistas of Mont Ventoux and the Dentelles de Montmirail![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-d3a0-61f6-b803-f9f0c3d384ad/raw?se=2025-09-26T07%3A34%3A00Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=4e28d40f-3854-590f-b9f6-3416507eade3&skoid=f28c0102-4d9d-4950-baf0-4a8e5f6cf9d4&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-09-25T17%3A52%3A59Z&ske=2025-09-26T17%3A52%3A59Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=TuNPcunoi2yM9YSZqY8XUtpbiIrJ7O0LUdN6PcFxgws%3D)domainevallot.com. The estate buildings retain a rustic Provençal charm that reflects the family’s history.
    
- **Link to Provençal culture.** The region’s culture shows in seasonal markets, olive oil, lavender and local gastronomy. Anaïs’s background in hospitality influences the domaine’s aesthetic: hospitality, elegance and a sense of home are integral to the visitor experience[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/portraits/anais-vallot-en/#:~:text=Ana%C3%AFs%20promotes%20a%20prestigious%2C%20international,worlds%20of%20luxury%20and%20travel).
    
- **Poetic identity.** The name “Vinsobres” itself is an oxymoron—“vin” for wine and “sobre” meaning sober—hinting at a playful, introspective character[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Vinsobres%2C%20what%20an%20unusual%20name%3A,the%20pride%20of%20its%20winemakers). The Latin etymology (_Vinsobris_) meaning vine and work underscores the region’s identity as a place of labour and artistry[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Vinsobres%2C%20what%20an%20unusual%20name%3A,the%20pride%20of%20its%20winemakers).
    

## 7\. Narrative Style & Differentiation

- **Elevated and poetic tone.** The domaine’s story is rich with generational continuity, a lofty terroir and biodynamic ethos. The narrative should evoke imagery of sunlit vineyards, the whispering Pontias wind and the hands of artisans coaxing expression from the soil.
    
- **Depth over breadth.** Unlike a landing page that focuses on converting first‑time visitors, the About‑Us/Domaine page should invite exploration, provide historical context and underscore authenticity and sustainability.
    
- **Pillars.** The story will rest on five pillars: **heritage**, **terroir**, **philosophy**, **people** and **wines**. Through these pillars, the page can weave past and present, place and person, craft and culture.

## Opening Statement

[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=High%20altitude%20vineyards%20surround%20Vinsobres%2C,key%20concept%20for%20the%20definition)Nestled among the gentle hills of **Vinsobres**, where limestone terraces meet the breeze of the Pontias and the silhouette of Mont Ventoux, our domaine looks out over a mosaic of vines and olive groves. Here, time slows to the rhythm of seasons and the Mistral whispers through the rows, carrying with it the stories of five generations. Domaine Vallot is more than a vineyard; it is a family saga rooted in place, nurtured by earth and guided by stars.

## Heritage & Legacy

[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=With%20their%20founding%20five%20generations,Demeter%20biodynamic%20certification%20in%202007)In 1900, the Vallot family planted their first vines on these rugged slopes. Over the decades, each generation added its own chapter. François Vallot, fourth‑generation vigneron, embraced organic farming long before it became fashionable. Through his dedication the estate earned **Ecocert organic certification in 2003** and **Demeter biodynamic certification in 2007**[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=With%20their%20founding%20five%20generations,Demeter%20biodynamic%20certification%20in%202007). His daughter **Anaïs**, after years working in luxury hotels around the world, returned home to infuse the domaine with fresh vision. She honours the meticulous craft learned from her father while bringing hospitality, elegance and openness to new audiences[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Now%2C%20as%20the%20fifth%20generation,her%20work%20at%20Domaine%20Vallot). Together, they carry forward a heritage that values respect for land, people and tradition.

## The Place & Terroir

[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Situated%20in%20Proven%C3%A7al%20Dr%C3%B4me%2C%20on,in%20the%20commune%20of%20Vinsobres)Our vines cling to terraces from 200 to 450 metres above sea level, making Vinsobres the **highest Cru in the Côtes‑du‑Rhône**. The soils here are **rocky limestone with sandy pockets**, and the high altitude endows our wines with a striking freshness[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=High%20altitude%20vineyards%20surround%20Vinsobres%2C,key%20concept%20for%20the%20definition). Facing south‑east, the vineyards bask in Provençal sun yet enjoy cool nights as the **Mistral** and **Pontias** winds sweep through, slowing ripening and preserving acidity[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Situated%20in%20Proven%C3%A7al%20Dr%C3%B4me%2C%20on,in%20the%20commune%20of%20Vinsobres). This unique micro‑climate—halfway between the Pre‑Alps and Mont Ventoux—gives our wines the spicy depth of the south and the tension of the north. The name **Vinsobres**, derived from the Latin “Vinsobris” meaning **vine** and **work**, reminds us that winegrowing here is both art and labour[vinsobres.fr](https://vinsobres.fr/en/discover/#section-436#:~:text=Vinsobres%2C%20what%20an%20unusual%20name%3A,the%20pride%20of%20its%20winemakers).

In the cellar, grapes ferment spontaneously with native yeasts in **traditional cement vats**, which allow gradual temperature changes and preserve the purity of fruit[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=They%20have%20always%20utilized%20the,yeasts%20present%20in%20the%20vineyard%E2%80%A6). We add only minimal sulphur, letting each parcel speak. The result is wines that capture the soul of their terroir—alive, expressive and elegant.

## The Wines

[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Ana%C3%AFs%20leads%20off%20her%20production,aging%20in%20traditional%20cement%20vats)Our wines are living expressions of our landscape. **Côtes‑du‑Rhône Le Coriançon** is a joyful **field blend** of grenache, syrah, mourvèdre, cinsault, clairette and bourboulenc, co‑picked from forty‑year‑old vines and aged in cement. It is juicy and approachable, with red‑berry vibrancy and a hint of spice. Our flagship **Cru Vinsobres “Le Coriançon”** marries grenache and old‑vine mourvèdre with syrah from hillside plots. Destemmed grapes ferment separately before ageing for over a year in concrete, yielding a wine of depth and finesse[demaisonselections.com](https://demaisonselections.com/vallot/#:~:text=Her%20flagship%20Cru%20Vinsobres%20is,vats%20for%20over%20one%20year). The **“Les Roches”** parcel selection offers a different facet—ruby‑hued, with aromas of red and dark fruits, spice and flowers, and a balanced palate that lingers long![](https://sdmntpritalynorth.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-97a4-6246-9e6b-0b976283d692/raw?se=2025-09-26T07%3A33%3A59Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=59e6aa10-6c42-5ece-ac9b-d1861f8eaba9&skoid=f28c0102-4d9d-4950-baf0-4a8e5f6cf9d4&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-09-25T17%3A53%3A02Z&ske=2025-09-26T17%3A53%3A02Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=yo1AL1cgSydj4ubdWb%2Bvb3cEZEjtH3vaCniLjwJSaV8%3D). Though each cuvée has its own voice, they share a signature: ripe fruit, pepper, aromatic herbs, silky tannins and an invigorating freshness that reflects the altitude and winds of Vinsobres.

## Closing Statement

The story of Domaine Vallot is one of **continuity and renewal**. Our vines have witnessed centuries of sunrise over Mont Ventoux and felt the same Pontias wind that cools our nights. They have been tended by hands that respect tradition yet are unafraid to evolve. When you open a bottle of our wine, you taste not only grenache or syrah but the history, landscape and people of Vinsobres. We invite you to join us on this journey—to walk among our vines, to savour our wines and to become part of our ongoing story.
