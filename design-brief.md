  # Domaine Vallot UI/UX Design Brief
  *Foundational Document for Website Development*

  ## Core Objective
  **Primary Job-to-be-Done:** Help Côtes du Rhône connoisseurs discover and purchase wines that connect them deeply to the terroir, heritage, and craftsmanship of seven generations of winemaking through a seamless       
  e-commerce experience.

  **Success Metric:** Users should feel they are "tasting the vineyard" and connecting with the living heritage of the domain, not just buying a product.

  ## Target User Persona: The Engaged Connoisseur

  ### Characteristics
  - Knowledgeable wine enthusiasts with established cellars
  - Purchase wine as investment in both taste and story
  - Value provenance, philosophy (biodynamics, family stewardship), and terroir specifics
  - Prioritize substance over flashy branding or point scores

  ### Core Needs
  - Access to substantive information: technical sheets, viticulture details, family history
  - Seamless purchasing process for allocations and specific vintages
  - Connection to the domaine through rich storytelling and authentic content
  - Validation of their expertise through detailed, accurate information

  ### Key Frustrations
  - Generic marketing without substance
  - Hidden or hard-to-find technical details
  - Aggressive, clunky sales funnels
  - Lack of information about soil, winemaking process, and people behind the label

  ## Design Principles

  ### User Experience Keywords
  **Primary Emotion:** Awe
  **Supporting Emotions:** Reverent, Connected, Enlightened, Immersed

  **Emotional Triggers to Design For:**
  - **Lineage:** "Tasting the wine, you feel the weight of seven generations"
  - **Living Vineyard:** "The vineyard transforms into a single, breathing organism"
  - **Terroir:** "The land itself is speaking through the wine"

  ### Layout & Information Architecture
  **Approach:** Content-rich discovery feed
  - Organic exploration respecting user intelligence
  - Rich visual stories, articles, and wine profiles
  - Technical data embedded within compelling narrative context
  - No forced linear paths - users follow their curiosity
  - Deep-dive capability for those seeking detailed information

  ### Interaction & Motion Philosophy
  **Approach:** Snappy and immediate with minimal animation
  - **Principle:** Function over flourish - make things work brilliantly rather than just look good
  - Quick, efficient navigation that doesn't distract from content
  - Clean, immediate interactions let wine and stories be the stars
  - Design guides users to action by starting with their intent
  - No unnecessary animations that slow down access to information

  ### Visual Language & Aesthetic
  **Direction:** Warm, artisanal, and heritage-focused
  - Rich textures and earth tones celebrating traditional craft
  - Typography that feels handcrafted yet readable
  - Celebrates seven generations of family legacy
  - Authentic connection to terroir and winemaking tradition

  ### Color Palette
  **Primary Colors:**
  - Limestone Clay (#EAE3D6) - warm off-white, "sun-warmed earth, mineral dust"
  - Vinsobres Rouge (#7B2423) - deep, earthy red, "the heart of old Grenache"

  **Supporting Colors:**
  - Olive Leaf (#626E5A) - muted, dusty green, "Provencal foliage"
  - Wet Slate (#414141) - dark charcoal-grey, "cellar stone, ancient terroir"

  **Accent Color:**
  - Golden Hour (#C89F5E) - muted ochre, "ancestral light" (for calls-to-action)

  ## Implementation Guidelines

  ### Content Strategy
  - Lead with story, embed technical details naturally
  - Prioritize vineyard imagery, family history, and winemaking process
  - Provide easy access to technical sheets and viticulture information
  - Use authentic, substantive language - avoid marketing fluff

  ### Navigation Design
  - Allow multiple entry points and discovery paths
  - Ensure technical information is never more than 2 clicks away
  - Create clear information hierarchy without overwhelming users
  - Support both browsing and targeted searching behaviors

  ### Typography & Imagery
  - Choose fonts that feel handcrafted yet professional
  - Use high-quality vineyard and cellar photography
  - Include family and winemaker portraits to humanize the story
  - Showcase terroir through close-up soil, vine, and landscape imagery
  
  ## Next Steps

  ### Immediate Actions
  1. **Wireframe Development:** Create low-fidelity layouts focusing on content-rich discovery patterns       
  2. **Component Library:** Develop UI components reflecting heritage aesthetic and efficient interactions    
  3. **Content Audit:** Inventory existing vineyard imagery, family stories, and technical documentation      
  4. **Typography Selection:** Choose font families that support the artisanal, heritage-focused direction    

  ### Phase 2 Considerations
  - High-fidelity mockups incorporating color palette and visual direction
  - Mobile-responsive design ensuring content richness translates to smaller screens
  - E-commerce integration maintaining the storytelling focus throughout purchase flow
  - Performance optimization to ensure "snappy and immediate" interactions
