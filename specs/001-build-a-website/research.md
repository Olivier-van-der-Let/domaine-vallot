# Phase 0: Technology Research & Patterns

## 1. Next.js 14 App Router with Internationalization

**Decision**: App Router with Dynamic Segments for Locale Handling using `app/[lang]` directory structure with server-side dictionary loading.

**Rationale**:
- App Router provides better performance with Server Components
- Dynamic segments automatically handle locale routing
- Server-side dictionary loading reduces client-side JavaScript bundle
- Built-in support for metadata per locale for SEO

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pages Router with next-i18next (deprecated approach)

- Automated customs documentation for international shipments
- Strong integration with EU e-commerce platforms

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct carrier integration (limited coverage, complex maintenance)
- ShipStation (less EU focus, fewer service points)
- EasyPost (primarily US-focused)

**Key Implementation Considerations**:
- Implement rate limiting (420 GET, 100 POST requests/minute)
- Cache shipping rates to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Use service points to improve delivery success rates (90%+ vs 70% home delivery)
- Handle international shipping requirements automatically
- Integrate tracking information with customer notifications

## 5. EU VAT Calculation and Compliance

**Decision**: Dynamic VAT System with VIES Validation for real-time VAT calculation with EU VIES validation for B2B transactions.

- Support for digital services and physical goods taxation rules
- Handles â‚¬10,000 distance selling threshold automatically

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Static tax tables (maintenance overhead, compliance risk)
- Third-party tax services like TaxJar (additional costs, less control)
- Manual VAT handling (error-prone, non-scalable)

**Key Implementation Considerations**:
- Store VIES validation results with timestamps for audit trail
- Implement OSS (One-Stop Shop) for simplified EU reporting
- Keep transaction records for 10 years as required by law
- Update VAT rates automatically from authoritative sources
- Handle edge cases like digital services taxation

## 6. Meta Catalog API Integration

**Decision**: Automated Feed Sync with Product Catalog API for real-time product synchronization with Facebook and Instagram shops.

**Rationale**:
- Direct integration with Facebook/Instagram commerce features
- Real-time product updates improve ad relevance
- Advanced targeting capabilities for retargeting campaigns
- Built-in shopping experiences reduce checkout friction
- Better conversion tracking and attribution

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual feed uploads (labor-intensive, outdated data)
- Third-party feed management tools (additional costs, complexity)
- CSV/XML static feeds (delayed updates, poor sync)

**Key Implementation Considerations**:
- Implement incremental sync for efficiency and cost reduction
- Handle API rate limits properly (600 requests per hour)
- Ensure product data quality and completeness for approval
- Set up error handling for failed syncs with retry logic
- Monitor feed approval status and handle rejections

## 7. Google Shopping Feed Generation

**Decision**: Merchant API with Automated Feed Updates using Google's new Merchant API for real-time product feed management.

- XML feed uploads (less dynamic, manual process)
- Third-party feed management tools (additional complexity, costs)

**Key Implementation Considerations**:
- Migrate from Content API before August 2026 deadline
- Implement only one update method (API or feeds, not both)
- Use batch operations for efficiency (up to 1000 products per batch)
- Monitor click potential metrics for optimization
- Integrate with Google Analytics for performance tracking

## 8. GDPR Compliance Implementation
