**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-website`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Finalized
**Input**: User description: "**Build a website that enables a boutique winery to sell its wines directly to European customers.**

* The site should be **mobile-first and bilingual (French & English)**, so it can reach and convert a pan-European audience.
* Visitors should experience **fast navigation, clear calls-to-action, and emotionally engaging storytelling** (family heritage, biodynamic practices, vineyard visuals) to build trust and connection.
* Each product page should provide **high-quality imagery, detailed tasting notes, food pairings, and visible certifications** (organic, biodynamic), reassuring customers about authenticity and quality.
* The **checkout must be simple, transparent, and trustworthy**, supporting EU-local payment methods, VAT-inclusive pricing, and clear shipping optionsminimizing friction and abandoned carts.
* The site must comply with **EU wine and e-commerce regulations**: age verification, labeling requirements, privacy/GDPR standards, and correct VAT/excise handling.
* A **centralized product catalog** should sync seamlessly to Google Shopping and Meta (Facebook/Instagram) catalogs, ensuring product info (price, stock, descriptions) is consistent across the website and ads.
* This integration allows the winery to run **paid ad campaigns and retargeting**, capturing immediate high-intent buyers, while also building **long-term visibility through SEO and storytelling-driven content**.
* The overall goal: **turn the winery's unique story and certifications into a competitive advantage**, driving conversions online while building brand trust and customer loyalty."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A European wine enthusiast visits the boutique winery's website to discover and purchase premium wines. They browse the bilingual website on their mobile device, learn about the winery's heritage and biodynamic practices, view detailed product information including tasting notes and certifications, add wines to their cart, and complete a secure checkout with transparent VAT-inclusive pricing and EU-compliant age verification.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a European customer visits the homepage, **When** they select their preferred language (French/English), **Then** all website content displays in their chosen language including product descriptions, legal notices, and checkout process
2. **Given** a customer browses wine products on mobile, **When** they tap on a wine bottle, **Then** they see high-quality product images, detailed tasting notes, food pairing suggestions, and visible organic/biodynamic certifications
3. **Given** a customer adds wines to their cart, **When** they proceed to checkout, **Then** they see VAT-inclusive pricing for their country, available local payment methods, and clear shipping options with costs
4. **Given** a customer completes age verification, **When** they submit payment information, **Then** the system processes the order according to EU wine regulations and sends order confirmation
5. **Given** a winery administrator updates product information, **When** the changes are saved, **Then** the updates automatically sync to Google Shopping and Meta catalogs maintaining consistency across all platforms

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a customer from a non-EU country attempts to purchase?
- How does the system handle age verification failure?
- What occurs if a product becomes out of stock during the checkout process?
- How does the system respond when payment processing fails?
- What happens if the customer's country has specific wine import restrictions?
